# KPR-DWH-DataSync
# KPR-DWH-DataPipeline

## Project Overview
This project involves the integration of Teradata and HANA DB using Kubeflow pipelines. The data from Teradata is replicated into HANA DB, specifically for the KPR and DWH systems.

## Folder Structure
- `calculation/`: Python scripts related to data processing and calculation.
- `input/`: Scripts and files for data input and preprocessing.
- `util/`: Utility scripts and helper functions.

    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Kubeflow and ensure access to Teradata and HANA DB.

## Running the Project
- Run the Kubeflow pipeline:
    ```bash
